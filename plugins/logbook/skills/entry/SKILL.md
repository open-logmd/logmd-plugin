description: Write one immutable per-invocation work-log note (entries/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<repo>) into the LogMD vault, recording what changed and why, tagged by repo so a day spanning many agents and services can be read, cross-referenced, and later synthesized by /logbook:ingest. Use when the user says "logbook", "bitácora", "guarda resumen", "resumen del día", or after landing a git commit / opening a PR.

# logbook · entry

Deliberately **self-contained**: unlike its three siblings this skill does not
read the plugin root's `ENGINE.md` first. It fires after every commit, and
capture is write-only — everything it needs is below. Read the engine only when
something here is ambiguous.

Working across many agents and services in parallel and losing the thread of what
got done where. This skill drops **one immutable note per invocation** — a small,
atomic log entry written as it happens. Reassembly is `/logbook:ingest`'s job: it
reads these notes and synthesizes cross-linked pages, linking together the ones
that share a topic.

Why one file per invocation (not one shared daily note): each note is written once
and never touched again. That immutability is what lets `ingest` track exactly
what it has already processed — a note that shows up after an ingest is always a
*new* file, never an edit to an already-read one, so nothing falls in the crack a
same-day-appended note had.

The summary is yours to write from the session context — nothing else can generate
it. Keep it to the *reasoning* git won't preserve, not a commit-log dump.

## When to log

- After you land a `git commit` or open a PR — one note per **meaningful unit of
  work**, not per WIP commit. (A `PostToolUse` hook fires on every commit and
  reminds you; the judgment of whether *this* commit is a unit of work is still
  yours. Say so and skip when it isn't.)
- Whenever the user says "logbook" / "bitácora" / "guarda resumen" / "resumen del
  día", or invokes `/logbook:entry`.

## Where

One file **per invocation**: **`entries/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<repo>`** in the
LogMD vault, written with the `logmd` MCP's `write` tool
(`document`). `<repo>` is the primary repo/service slug — the **repository** name,
not the product's and not the org's; the vault's `wiki/CLAUDE.md` keeps the alias
table, and a raw note is never re-tagged after the fact.

- The path carries **no extension**: `write` appends `.md` itself.
- Date and time are in your context — don't guess them. `HHMM` (no colon — it's a
  filename), so the name sorts chronologically.
- **Check the path first** with `exec` (`ls entries/ | grep <YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>`).
  If that exact name exists (same repo, same minute), suffix `-2`, `-3`, … A
  `write` at an existing path with `position: replace` **destroys** the note that
  was there — the one failure this whole layer is built to prevent.
- **MCP down → say so and stop.** No `curl` at the endpoint, no writing the note
  to a local file "for later". The user reconnects with `/mcp`, then the note gets
  written. (A note that only lives in this session's context is not persisted
  work — that is the vault's own recorded lesson.)

## Note format

Follows the vault's `entry-note` template. Frontmatter plus the four
sections — pass `content` and `frontmatter` to `write` in one call:

```yaml
type: log-entry           # required by OKF; what the 170+ existing notes use (not `log`)
date: 2026-09-02          # ISO 8601
repo: dotfiles            # the repository slug, bare
title: …                  # the note's headline — this is the document's H1
description: …            # one line; it is what shows in every listing of entries/
tags: [repo/dotfiles]     # plus a shared #topic when one applies
```

```markdown
## What changed

## Why

## Notes

## Follow-up
```

**Blank lines around every block.** One before and after each list, table and
fenced block, and one after every `##`. The shape that violates it constantly is a
bold lead-in glued to its items — a `**…**` line with a `-` directly beneath it,
which is MD032 on every bullet. Table separator rows are spaced too:
`| --- | --- |`, never `|---|---|` (MD060, one warning per pipe). A note is
immutable, so a warning written here is permanent; there is no fix pass later.

**The body has no `#` heading** — `title:` is the H1, and a second one is an MD025
violation on every note. Sections start at `##`. (The ~196 notes before 2026-09-06
carry no `title:` and open with a `# YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <repo>` line instead; four
notes from that day carry both and are the vault's only standing lint warnings.
They are raw and immutable — read them, never "fix" them.)

Those older notes also carry the Spanish headings (`Qué cambió` / `Por qué` /
`Notas` / `Seguimiento`) the template used to have. Same rule: leave them.

- **`Why` is the section that earns the note.** What changed is in the diff;
  the decision, the alternative rejected, and the constraint that forced it are not.
- The `repo/<name>` tag is what lets `ingest` and `lint` slice by service.
- When one problem spans several services or sessions, give the notes a **shared
  topic tag** — that shared tag is what makes `ingest` link them together into (or
  across) the same wiki page. That's the payoff: several invocations on one topic
  come out linked after ingestion.

## Language

**Write the note in English**, whatever language the session is being conducted
in — same rule as the repo, and since 2026-09-06 the vault's too, paths and prose
alike. The 199 older notes are Spanish and stay that way: raw is immutable, so
never "fix" one.

## What this skill does NOT do

Write to `wiki/`, `sources/` or `specs/`, update `index.md`, or touch `log.md`.
Capture is write-only and deliberately dumb; synthesis is `/logbook:ingest`. Raw
stays messy on purpose.

The vault's folders are `entries/` (raw) and `wiki/` (synthesized); `logbook` is
the name of the plugin that reads and writes them, never a path. `entries/` was
`bitacora/` until 2026-09-06.
