# ─── PostToolUse hook: remind to write the logbook entry after a commit ───
#
# A skill cannot fire on an event — it only self-activates on what the user says.
# The entry is supposed to be written after a commit lands, and "the model
# remembers to" is exactly the guarantee a prose rule in CLAUDE.md does not give.
# So the event half lives here and the how-to half stays in the skill: this script
# only detects the commit and hands back one line of context.
#
# Registered by the plugin's own hooks/hooks.json and invoked as
# `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/logbook.sh"` — through bash on purpose, so a
# checkout with no exec bit still runs.
#
# Contract: hook input arrives as JSON on stdin, and stdout is read back as JSON.
# `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` is the field that reaches the model —
# plain stdout would only show up in transcript view, which nobody reads mid-turn.
# ANY other output breaks the parse, so every failure path below must exit silent.
